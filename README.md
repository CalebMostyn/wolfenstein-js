# wolfenstein-js

This is a very unoptimized JavaScript implementation of a 2D raycast 3D renderer (similar to Wolfenstein3D). Utilizes [p5.js](p5js.org) for graphics and can be easily ran from the browser. If you wanted to run it locally, it just needs to be on a HTTP server (basic python will do).

This was written for another [project](https://github.com/CalebMostyn/wolfenstein-fpga), essentially as a prototype, but is fun enough to play around with on its own. The code is very messy and unoptimized, I may come back at another point to fix that.
